# Podded

This simple calculator asks you for an average of Nespresso cups you drink per day, and then calculates how much plastic you're emitting per unit of time, comparing these amounts to the weight of larger single objects.

It's a simple, fun way to visualize the amount of plastic you're emitting, and how much you could reduce it by switching to a more sustainable coffee habit, like reusable metal pods.

Statically runnable, also deployed on Github Pages [here](https://swader.github.io/podded/).
